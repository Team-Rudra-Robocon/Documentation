## Introduction

Introduction to ROS2, what is that and how it is used.


<b>Note</b> :
Before starting with ROS2 note that there are many distributions of ROS2 like:

1. Humble (Ubuntu 22)
2. Foxy (Ubuntu 20)
3. Jazzy (made for Ubuntu 24.04)
4. etc.

But there distributions only supports only specific type of OS eg. ROS2 - Humble supports OS up until Ubuntu 22 and nothing after that. Even the gazebo pairing with each distributions is different, if you choose a different gazebo distribution your program may not work. So check your own Linux version and choose a distribution accordingly.


## What is ROS2?

Its Robot Operating System. It provides standard for robot programming. It helps in understanding the robot functionality.

It can help in programming high level functionality using easy programming.

It has packages which help in easily programming a robot with Nav2 and Rviz.


## When to use it?

- When many inputs and output and requires many communication
- Use-case is that, for mobile robot that is used for locomotion of any sort



## What is ROS2? (Detailed)

It provides a way to separated code into blocks, helps in code separation, where each node will communicate with each other which is powerful and scalable.

It even helps in navigation (NAV2).

It has builtin libraries and can be programmed in many programming language like 1 project in multiple languages.

Its even open-source and its awesome for robotics projects.

<b>Note</b>:
I have been using Jazzy for the projects so there may be some changes for other distribution during installation and setup.
