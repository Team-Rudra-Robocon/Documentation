 <P> Introduction to ROS2 ,what is that and how it is used 

Note : Before starting with ROS2 note that there are many distributions of ROS2 like 
1. Humble(Ubuntu 22)
2. Foxy (Ubuntu 20)
3. jazzy (made for Ubuntu 24.04)
 etc. 

But there distributions only support sonly specific type of OS eg. ROS2 - Humble supports OS uptill Ubuntu 22 and nothing after that. Even the gazebo pairing with each distributions is different , if you choose a different gazebo distribution your program may not work . So check your own Linux version and choose a distribution accordingly. 
 
<P> Its Robot Operating system it provides standerd for robot programming. It helps in
understaing the robot functionality
it can help in programming high level functionality using easy programming
it has packages which help in easily programming a robot with Nav2 and Rviz.

#### when to use it ?
- when many inputs and output and requires many communication and usecase is that , for mobile
robot that is used for locomotion of any sort

#### what is ROS2 ?
it provides a way to saperated code into blocks , helps in code saperation , where each node will comunicate with each other which is powerful and scalable 
It even helps in navigation (NAV2)
it has builtin libraries and can be programmed in many programming language like 1 project in multiple languages 
its even opensource and its awesome for robotics Projects.

 
Note: I have been using Jazzy for the projects so there may be some changes for other distribution during installation and setup.
