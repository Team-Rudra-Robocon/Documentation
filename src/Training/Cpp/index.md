## Why introduce C++ and not C
The question demands a 2 part answer - 
1. Birth of modern programming languages
2. Why C++ and not C

---

### 1. Birth of modern programming languages
Even though it is technically possible to utilise a processor or microcontroller to execute certain tasks with just 0's and 1's, that was never a plausible way to write large/complex pieces of code.

This led to the development of assembly with different versions of assembly being written for processors and controllers supporting different architectures. Assembly still posed a very high skill cap toward what a programmer could hope to achieve. It's requirement for repetitive instructions were a large drawback withholding programmers from advancing the field.

To provide a closer to english way to write instructions/code the modern programming languages came into picture. 

```
NOTE: The compiler isn't a topic that can be covered in a page in an mdbook, and neither
is it within the scope of your work as part of the team. You are free to explore the 
same.
```

### 2. Why C++ and not C
C language is widely considered as a higher construct to writing programs on the lowest-level(closest to hardware) of a device. Due to the same reason, it is also considered an extremely unsafe language, allowing the developer and end-user to exploit the written program and it's resultant working at any given instance.

C++ is an attempt at lightening that blow. Modern C++ upto C++20, has largely succeeded with this aim, but still requires talented developers to write safe code. This is mainly due to the raw capacity in which the C and C++ can achieve low level access. Due to fundamental faults in the design of the languages, things like buffer overflows, and corruption due to wrong type-casts is extremely common with code written by novice developers. Languages like Rust have successfully overcome nearly all of the faults seen in C and C++ as a low level language, but in doing the same, have become overly complicated for an average student to pick up fast and see results.

C++ has added onto C extreme capabilities, which you'll find out as you go through this documentation. The general opinion being, it's better to be a bad C++ developer than a bad C developer, and better to be a good C++ developer than a good C developer. With a clear win like this with the tradeoff being a processing overhead, negligible for modern controllers and processors, C++ is the way to go, moving forward.

```
NOTE: Realistically, RUST is the way to go, moving forward. So if you are capable of the 
same, go for it. Otherwise pair python with C++ and become capable of being happy as a 
developer(*maybe).
