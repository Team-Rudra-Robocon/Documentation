A topic is a critical section in OS , where a publisher publishes to the topic and a subscriber subscribes to a topic , its like a shared space , therefore publisher and subscribers uses topics to publish and subscribe to information. a Topic can have mant publishers and many subscribers the subscribers receive msgs from all the publishers , this can be done by creating a node to publish and subscribe to it.
<P>A publisher only publishes data , it dosent know who the subscriber is and similarly the subscriber just takes data from the topic and dosent know who published it to the topic.
similarty a single publisher can publish to different topics as well.

A topic is used to send a data stream and itis unidirectional there is no feedback a topic has a msg type and the pubs and subs should follow the msg type , this can be written in py , cpp ...directly inside the node. This can help in saperating the code and communicationg using topics.



### Creating a Publisher : 
```
.create_publisher(msg_type , topic_name , 10) 
```
this function helps in creating a publisher and add the topic name to it  , the topic name is like the critical section , that helps in publishing the information

```
.publish(msg)
 ```

this helps in publishing the msg to the topic.

### Creating a Subscriber : 
```
.create_subscription(msg_type , topic_name , callback_function , 10)
```

this function creates a subscription to the topic mentioned , it even stored to data into a callback function which needs to be created inside the node itself, then it that data can be printed on the terminal using
``` getlogger().info() ```


### more about topics and how to debug topic using command line tools
```
ros2 topic
```
this can handle topics and it has many functionalities to debug it 
```
ros2 topic list
```
this gets you the list of running topics

```
ros2 topic info
```
this gets you the information of the specified topic

```
ros2 topic echo (topic name)
```

this creates the subscriber on the terminal itslef to ensure that the data is publishing succesfully
```
ros2 topic hz (topic name)
```
this gets you the avg rate and frequency of the running program

```
ros2 topic pub -r 10 (topic name)
```
rate of publishing 10hz here
say you have 2 publishers publishing at different rates , the receiver / subscriber will receive the data in that rate only , say one publisher is publishing at 10hz and other at 20 hz the publisher publishing at 20hz will send more data than 10hz puublisher , this helps in having different publisher publihs at different rates

### remaping a topic at runtime

like remaping a node we can also rename a topic at runtime 
```
ros2 run my_py_pkg robot_news_station --ros-args -r __node:=my_station
```
something like this , it remaps the node here , to do the same for topic we simply add another flag 

```
ros2 run my_py_pkg robot_new_station --ros-args -r __node:=my_station -r robot_news:=my_news

ros2 run my_py_pkg robot_news_subscriber --ros-args -r robot_news = my_news 
```
here robot_news is the hardcoded topic in my publisher and subscriber file , therfore the above command will check if there exixt any robotnews , if it does then it will replace it with mynews , now if you check the subscribtion it will not receive anything as the topic name is changed , you also need to change the topic name for subscriber as well. Now the subs will start printing the data
